# Images Directory

This directory should contain image resources for the ArcGIS Pro Add-in.

## Required Images

- `AddinDesktop32.png` - 32x32 icon for the add-in
- `GenericButtonBlue16.png` - 16x16 icon for button (small)
- `GenericButtonBlue32.png` - 32x32 icon for button (large)

These images are referenced in Config.daml but are not included in this test repository.
When developing actual add-ins, you would add appropriate PNG images here.
