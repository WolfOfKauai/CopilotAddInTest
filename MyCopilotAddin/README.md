# MyCopilotAddin

This ArcGIS Pro sample add-in uses a DockPane to guide the user through a GIS workflow. The DockPane provides the following functionality:

1. **Parcel Lots Selection**: Allows the user to select a parcel Lots feature from the map and displays the selected parcel's ID.
2. **Resolution Selection**: Includes a drop-down option to select the final multi-patch polygon resolution. The resolution can be set from 0 (rough) to 100 (fine) in increments of 10.
3. **3D Lots Creation**: Contains a button to initiate the 3D Lots creation process using the selected parcel Lots as input.

This add-in is designed to streamline the process of creating 3D representations of parcel lots in ArcGIS Pro.

## Features

- **Interactive DockPane**: A user-friendly interface for selecting and processing parcel lots.
- **Customizable Resolution**: Fine-tune the resolution of the 3D multi-patch polygon.
- **Seamless Integration**: Built to work seamlessly within the ArcGIS Pro environment.
